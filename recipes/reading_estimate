1. Describe the problem
As a user
So that I can manage my time
I want to see an estimate of reading time for a text, assuming that I can read 200 words a minute.

2. Design the method signature

# 'reading_estimate' checks a text for how many words and calculates time to read based on 200 wds per min
reading_time = reading_estimate(text)
# returns the time as an integer representing minutes. Time rounded to nearest minute. 
number_of_words/200

3. 
# 1
reading_estimate("")
# => 0

# 2
reading_estimate(two hundred words)
# => 1

# 3
reading_estimate(three hundred words)
# => 2

# 4
reading_estimate(five hundred words)
# => 3
